# STM32CubeWB0 MCU Firmware Package


**STM32Cube** is an STMicroelectronics original initiative to ease the developers' life by reducing efforts, time and cost.

**STM32Cube** covers the overall STM32 products portfolio. It includes a comprehensive embedded software platform delivered for each STM32 series (such as the STM32CubeWB0 for the STM32WB0 series).
   * The CMSIS modules (core and device) corresponding to the ARM(tm) core implemented in this STM32 product.
   * The STM32 HAL-LL drivers, an abstraction layer offering a set of APIs ensuring maximized portability across the STM32 portfolio.
   * The BSP drivers of each evaluation, demonstration or nucleo board provided for this STM32 series.
   * A consistent set of middleware libraries such as STM32_BLE, RTOS, FatFS.
   * A full set of software projects (basic examples, applications, and demonstrations) for each board provided for this STM32 series.

The **STM32CubeWB0 MCU Package** projects are directly running on the STM32WB0 series boards. You can find in each Projects/*Board name* directories a set of software projects (Applications/Demonstration/Examples).
